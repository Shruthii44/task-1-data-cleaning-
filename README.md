Data cleaning and preprocessing of Medical Appointment No Show dataset
# Task 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

## Dataset
Medical Appointment No Show dataset from Kaggle.

## What I Did
- Checked for missing values (none found)
- Removed duplicate rows
- Standardized text columns (`Gender`, `No-show`, `Neighbourhood`)
- Converted `ScheduledDay` and `AppointmentDay` to datetime
- Fixed data types (Age as int, Gender and No-show as categorical)
- Saved cleaned dataset for further analysis

## Files
- `cleaned_dataset.csv` → cleaned data
- `data_cleaning_script.ipynb` → Python code
