# Task 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

## Dataset
Medical Appointment No Show dataset from Kaggle.
customer personality analysis

## What I Did
- Checked for missing values (none found)
- Removed duplicate rows
- Standardized text columns (`Gender`, `No-show`, `Neighbourhood`)
- Converted `ScheduledDay` and `AppointmentDay` to datetime
- Fixed data types (Age as int, Gender and No-show as categorical)
- Saved cleaned dataset for further analysis

 Removed duplicate rows

Filled missing income values with median

Standardized text columns (education, marital_status)

Converted dt_customer column to datetime format

Renamed columns to lowercase with underscores

Ensured correct data types (year_birth as int, income as float)
